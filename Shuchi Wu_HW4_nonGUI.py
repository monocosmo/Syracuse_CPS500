######################################################################################
# In this homework, we implement a "Hangman" game with Python.                       #
# This is a non-GUI version (Problem 1 and Problem 2).                               #
#                                                                                    #
# Game rules:                                                                        #
# 1. The game starts with a prize pool of $1500.                                     #
# 2. The game ends when the prize decrements to $0 or below $0.                      #
# 3. Each time the user guesses a letter, that balance is reuced by                  #
#    either $100 (if the letter is in the puzzle and hadn't been guessed)            #
#    or $150 (if the letter is not in the puzzle, or if it had been guessed)         #
#                                                                                    #
# Note: Rule #2 is ambiguous when prize reaches $50 and only one letter unsolved,    #
# because the user may "win" the game with a prize of -$50. To solve this problem,   #
# I decided to give the user one more chance to guess at prize $50, and whenever     #
# the prize goes below $0, the system will adjust the residual prize to $0. So the   #
# user can "win" the game with a prize of $0 (instead of "strange" -$50).            #
#                                                                                    #
# My previous design is to kick the user out when prize reaches $100 to avoid -$50   #
# situation, but the user may feel "angry" when they see still $50 left but been     #
# kicked out (although it is reasonable).                                            #

# 1. Set up answer and prize, initiate guessed record and solved status.
# 2. Ask if the user want to solve (make a one time guess).
# 3. If not, ask the user for a guess (input to guess one character).
# 4. Check if the input is in puzzle or guessed.
# 5. Update the guessed record and the answer with input.
# 6. Update the prize.
# 7. When out of while-loop, print the conclusion.
